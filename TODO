* Feeds
** DONE Relative links
   CLOSED: [2009-01-10 Сбт 22:14]
   Descriptions of feed items should not contain relative links.

** DONE Handle slashes properly in blogtag feeds

   Accessing /feeds/blogtag/GNU/Linux/ fails
* Tests
** TODO Use nose
   Not, not to sniff bugs.

   I should add a Makefile `check` rule which will run `nosetests(1)`.
* TODO OpenID
* TODO RDF

  - [ ] Add DC data to posts

* Comment form
** TODO Provide better form errors handling

* Archive
** TODO More meaningful page titles
   Currently all pages under `/blog/archive/` have the same title.
   That's bad.
** TODO Next/previous period links
* TODO Author page link
  There must be no link to the author page in the footer when we're
  already there.

  It's unclear how to test what page we're on. Special flag context
  variable can't be used here because flatpage view does not provide
  any way to utilize extra context.
