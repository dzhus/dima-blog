** Bookmark
   Entry permalinks are marked with `rel="bookmark"`. Combined with
   `about={{ entry.get_absolute_url }}` in enclosing `div` element
   this leads to loops in extracted RDF, with every entry being a
   bookmark of itself. Probably I'm misusing `bookmark`.

   This keyword is among reserved values of `rel` in [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-rdfa-syntax-20081014/][XHTML+RDFa]] spec
   and is also listed in standard XHTML profile:

** Standard XHTML links
   Apart from standard `alternate`, `icon` and `stylesheet` :)
   `<link>`s, several more semantically rich `rel` values are used on
   several pages.
